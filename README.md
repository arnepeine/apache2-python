# Calculation of the APACHE II ("Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II") score in Python

The APACHE II ("Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II") is a severity-of-disease classification system (Knaus et al., 1985), one of several ICU scoring systems. It is applied within 24 hours of admission of a patient to an intensive care unit (ICU): an integer score from 0 to 71 is computed based on several measurements; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death. The first APACHE model was presented by Knaus et al. in 1981.
- Note: The data used should be from the initial 24 hours in the ICU, worst value should be used.
